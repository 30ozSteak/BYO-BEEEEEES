## Project: BYO-BEEEEEEE

## Group Member Names: Jessica Erickson, Nick Dambrosio

## Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?

Jessica: a useable API. This is handy information and I want it to be in a digestable format. A lot of bee websites are ... bad. and require a lot of redirects and clicking through nonsense websites. By converging all of this information into a single source it would make it a lot more accessible and useable

Nick: Get gud at scraping. Make a useful API.

## Goals and expectations:

Building / Populating APIs so the data is in a useable format that's filled with relevant and important information about bees.

## Team strengths:

Biceps, triceps, driving ability. Mostly Quads

## How to overcome obstacles:

Googling, stack overflow, bugging the people nextdoor in BE4

## Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):

Jessica: I can work during worktime and any time in the evenings up until around 8 or 9, depending on when Tim goes home.

Nick: I live a few blocks away and will be ready and able for paired programming every day until project completion, up until 4-5pm. Any additional/later times can be arranged.

## Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):

Slack, trello.

## Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

Jessica: I feel pretty solid on express and knex concepts, but I need more practice writing the code. I would also like more practice with refactoring.

Nick: Knex, Express, and having some fun with scraping would be pretty great.

## Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

Driver / Navigator / Paired programming for as much as possible. No front-end makes nick a sad boy.

## Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):

Very small, granular git commits. Descriptive commit messages. Pull request template filled out and test suite ran before commits.

## Agenda to discuss project launch:

Day 1 Kickoff - Clear all EOD requirements, get DB schema approved
Day 2 Data - Pull data in for tables. We decided Nick would scrape the web for all descriptions of the bees, pulling from google, and Jessica would grab their locations and host (pest/food) information
Day 3 Cleaning up Data - Nick : finish massive bee object, seed into DB, prepare for tomorrow. Jessica:

## Tools: Trello

Additional Notes: Have a good day ðŸ˜ƒ
